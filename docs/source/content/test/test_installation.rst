   * gffutils >= 0.10.0
   * miniprot >= 0.10.0

.. .. admonition:: Version warning
..    :class: important

..    LiftOn is currently not compatible with the latest version of :code:`python=3.11.4` due to a dependency issue with :code:`pybedtools`. We are currently investigating and will patch in a future update. In the meantime, we recommend running in a :code:`python=3.10` environment, as shown below

..       $ conda create -n myenv python=3.10

There are three ways that you can install LiftOn:

.. _install-through-pip:

Install through pip
-------------------------

LiftOn is on `PyPi 3.12 <https://pypi.org/project/lifton/>`_ now. Check out all the releases `here <https://pypi.org/manage/project/lifton/releases/>`_. Pip automatically resolves and installs any dependencies required by LiftOn.

.. code-block:: bash
   
   $ pip install LiftOn

|

.. _install-from-source:

Install from source
-------------------------

You can also install LiftOn from source. Check out the latest version on `GitHub <https://github.com/Kuanhao-Chao/LiftOn>`_
!

.. code-block:: bash

   $ git clone https://github.com/Kuanhao-Chao/LiftOn

   $ python setup.py install

|

.. _install-through-conda: 

Install through conda
-------------------------------

Installing LiftOn through conda is the easiest way to go:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   TBC

   $ conda install -c bioconda lifton

|

.. _check-LiftOn-installation:

Check LiftOn installation
-------------------------------------

Run the following command to make sure LiftOn is properly installed:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   $ lifton -h
