Closely-related species lift-over
====================================

.. When you want to annotate your newly assembled genome, and you realized that there is no same species reference annotation that is previously annotated, or there is a closely related species that is way much more anotated than your assembled species. In this case, you can run LiftOn to lift-over annotations between two closely-related speceis. 

.. LiftOn excels in performing lift-over on annotations between two closely-related species. Here ase an example of running LiftOn to lift-over annotations from *Homo sapiens* GRCh38 to *Pan troglodytes* (chimpanzee).


When you intend to annotate your recently assembled genome and find that there is no pre-annotated reference for the same species or that a closely related species has significantly better annotations than your assembled species, you can use LiftOver to transfer annotations between the two species.

LiftOver is particularly effective in mapping annotation between closely-related species. Here is an example of using LiftOver to transfer annotations from *Homo sapiens* GRCh38 to *Pan troglodytes* (chimpanzee).
