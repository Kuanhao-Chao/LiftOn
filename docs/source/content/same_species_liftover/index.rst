Same species lift-over
====================================


.. When dealing with a newly assembled genome, users often encounter the need to lift-over or convert the genome annotation from a reference genome to the new assembly.

.. LiftOn performs well on the same species annotation Lift-over. Here ase some examples of running LiftOn on *Homo sapiens*, *Arabidopsis thaliana*, and *Apis mellifera*.

When working with a recently assembled genome, users frequently face the necessity to lift-over or convert the genome annotation from a reference genome to the new assembly.

LiftOn excels in performing lift-over on annotations within the same species. Here ase some examples of running LiftOn on *Homo sapiens*, *Arabidopsis thaliana*, and *Apis mellifera*.
