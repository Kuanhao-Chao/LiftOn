      * Optional input (Liftoff annotation):
      -L gff, --liftoff gff
                              the annotation generated by Liftoff (or) name of Liftoff gffutils database; if not specified, the -liftoff argument must be

                              be provided and a database will be built automatically

      * Output settings:
      -o FILE, --output FILE
                              write output to FILE in same format as input; by default, output is written to "lifton.gff3"
      -u FILE               write unmapped features to FILE; default is "unmapped_features.txt"
      -exclude_partial      write partial mappings below -s and -a threshold to unmapped_features.txt; if true partial/low sequence identity mappings

      -infer-genes          use if annotation file only includes transcripts, exon/CDS features
      -infer_transcripts    use if annotation file only includes exon/CDS features and does not include transcripts/mRNA
      -chroms TXT           comma seperated file with corresponding chromosomes in the reference,target sequences
      -unplaced TXT         text file with name(s) of unplaced sequences to map genes from after genes from chromosomes in chroms.txt are mapped;

      -copies               look for extra gene copies in the target genome
      -sc SC                with -copies, minimum sequence identity in exons/CDS for which a gene is considered a copy; must be greater than -s; default
                              is 1.0
      -overlap O            maximum fraction [0.0-1.0] of overlap allowed by 2 features; by default O=0.1
      -mismatch M           mismatch penalty in exons when finding best mapping; by default M=2

      Alignments:
      -mm2_options =STR     space delimited minimap2 parameters. By default ="-a --end-bonus 5 --eqx -N 50 -p 0.5"
      -a A                  designate a feature mapped only if it aligns with coverage ≥A; by default A=0.5
      -s S                  designate a feature mapped only if its child features (usually exons/CDS) align with sequence identity ≥S; by default S=0.5
      -d D                  distance scaling factor; alignment nodes separated by more than a factor of D in the target genome will not be connected in
                              the graph; by default D=2.0
      -flank F              amount of flanking sequence to align as a fraction [0.0-1.0] of gene length. This can improve gene alignment where gene
                              structure differs between target and reference; by default F=0.0
